"""
An XMPP MUC client.
This XMPP Client logs in as C{user@example.org}, joins the room
C{'room@muc.example.org'} using the nick C{'greeter'} and responds to
greetings addressed to it. If another occupant writes C{'greeter: hello'}, it
will return the favor.
This example uses L{MUCClient} instead of the protocol-only
L{MUCClientProtocol<wokkel.muc.MUCClientProtocol>} so that it can hook into
its C{receivedGroupChat}. L{MUCClient} implements C{groupChatReceived} and
makes a distinction between messages setting the subject, messages that a
part of the room's conversation history, and 'live' messages. In this case,
we only want to inspect and respond to the 'live' messages.
